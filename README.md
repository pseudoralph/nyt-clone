# NY Times clone

#### NY Times clone website

#### Ralph Perdomo. January 25, 2019

## Description

A study in converting a site to Angular

## Details

This study attempts to modularize the NYTimes website by creating logical components to represent website functionality. This includes a navigation bar (accessible by the ubiquitous pancake stack) that responds much like the NYTimes' site doesâ€” click to open, mouse out to close. Navigation is a seperate component (navigation-component) this is attached to the app-component module .

Similar functionality was observed and duplicated in the search module (accessible by the magnifying glass icon). It operates as a toggle, where the only way to close it is by clicking on the icon. Search is then passed along to a method at the header-component level.

The current date displayed on the left-hand side is produced by parsing JS's Date.now() object. This is handled by an imported module (date-builder.ts).

The briefings section is a seperate component detached from heading-component. It instantiates breifings articles provided by a class module (models/briefings-article.ts). Additionally, the breifings section calls on an API (openweather & alphavantage) to retreive up-to-date stock market numbers (DJIA & S&P500) along with localilized weather. 

Note, the above features were implement past Friday's deadline and are still considered works-in-progress (will be refactoring into seperate components & researching other methods to fulfill a promise).

Hierarchical overview:

* app-component
  * navigation-comonent
  * header-component
  * briefing-component
  * main-content-component

## Setup/Installation Requirements

The following API keys are necessary to successfull build and launch this environment: ipStack, OpenWeatherMap, and Alphavantage. Enter these keys into the `template.env.js` file and rename to `.env.js` before launching.

* clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/pseudoralph/nyt-clone`
* navigate into this repo and download dependencies: `npm install`
* launch dev environment using `ng serve --open`
  * a new browser window will open at `localhost:4200`

## Technologies Used

JS, Angular

## Objectives
 - [x] Project includes a detailed README with information on all completed features as well as features to be added.

 - [x] Project includes a detailed commit history that clearly shows at least eight hours of work between 8 and 5 on Friday. You are also welcome to put additional work into your project outside of that time frame.

 - [x] Project demonstrates understanding of this week's concepts. If prompted, you are able to discuss your code with an instructor using correct terminology.
